```{r}

```

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3
{r, chunk_learningassessment_df}
library(tidyverse)
la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```

The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.
